* ### This is a tool for those aiming for Full Collection! In Normal mode it has randomness which means there's a chance a bad thing could be suggested(but almost null), in Chaos mode literally anything will be shown, so it's as useless as can be, Helpful mode will only suggest the optimal crafts. If you follow the Helpful mode suggestions you will be making the wisest choices if you aim for Full Collection down the road.
* ### Crafting Formula: Rarity x Number of Copies you Miss x Card Rating
* ### Card rating is based on META presence of that card.
