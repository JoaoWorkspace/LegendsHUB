## Dare Yourself on Stream
* ### All the cards that you don't own have a chance to pop up, either a tier 5 High King Emeric or a tier 1 Lich's Ascension.
* ### Once you start you can't chicken out, your followers are watching.


## Help Guide
* ### This tool serves as a guide for you, since although all cards have a chance, they don't have the same chance. The odds of getting High King Emeric are 5x bigger than Lich's Ascension
* ### There are far more average and good cards than there are bad cards, which means the chances of being suggested to craft a bad card is insanely small, unlikely to happen.
* ### Although you'll get a good suggestion most of the times, that's not always the case so I recommend clicking on a card to find out their Rating(1-5) and how many copies you miss, you might want to spin the wheel again.


## Full Collection Priority
* ### Legendary Odds = 9x Epic Odds = 9x Rare Odds = 9x Common Odds
* ### Tier 5 Odds = 5x Tier 1 Odds.
* ### Tier 4 Odds = 4x Tier 1 Odds. 
* ### Tier 3 Odds = 3x Tier 1 Odds. 
* ### Tier 2 Odds = 2x Tier 1 Odds.


## Crafting Weight Formula
* ### Rarity x Rating(or Tier) x Missing Copies
* ### Legendary Rarity = 6561
* ### Epic Rarity = 729
* ### Rare Rarity = 81
* ### Common Rarity = 9


### This tool is meant for players like me whose goal is to have the full collection as fast as possible so for that to happen, Legendaries even if they're bad (Lich's Ascension) will be always be preferred over an Epic, Rare or Common, since those have higher chance of getting caught in packs. This means it's better to craft a Lich's Ascension than a tier 5 epic, for example. Value over Quality.
